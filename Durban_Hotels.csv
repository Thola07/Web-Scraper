The Oyster Box,"Overlooking the Umhlanga Lighthouse and Indian Ocean, The Oyster Box offers 2 outdoor pools, an award winning spa and free Wi-Fi. Gateway Shopping Center is 1.2 mi away. The breakfast was second to none. I was expecting stuffy, formal staff and they could not have been more friendly. I wish I could name them all, but our favourite was Richard, who greeted us with a warm and friendly smile every evening at the lift. The food was outstanding. The customer services manager's approach to his guests was outstanding.",689 reviews,9.4
